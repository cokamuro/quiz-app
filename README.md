## Description
This is the solution HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the 02-Challenge assignment in the 04-WEB-APIs Module.

The purpose of the assignment was to create a quiz application that is timed, keeps score, and maintains a high score list.

This application runs off of an array of questions, and it dynamically adjusts to the number of answers.  The user is penalized 5 seconds for each wrong answer, and the final score is the time remaining on the clock when the questions are completed.
